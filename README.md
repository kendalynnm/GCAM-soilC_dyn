# GCAM-soilC_dyn
Pulling out soil C dynamics (accumulation and loss) from GCAM data


As agricultural land is converted from conventional to CA practices, soil carbon will accumulate in that soil.

Each year, new land is convereted,
so accumulation of soil carbon within a given basin/technology combination will have the same dynamics
just with different starting years for accumulation


Tasks:

Adding in appropriate baseline
Looping over basin/technology combinations
Dealing with decreases in land allocation
